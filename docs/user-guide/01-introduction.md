# Introduction to the Lipstick Trading System

## What is the Lipstick Trading System?

The Lipstick system is a tool to observe price movements in the market referenced by price/time segments. The reason why this is relevant information is that it would appear that price action (driven by algorithms) references these price time levels and reacts somewhat predictably. Using the Lipstick system and studying the patterns will provide beneficial anticipations in price action.

## Core Concept

Price is fractal, and we have layers of price segments. The Lipstick system tracks algorithmic price behavior through time-segmented sessions, calculates ranges based on specific price levels, and monitors how price interacts with these levels to identify trading opportunities.

## Key Components

The system consists of three main elements:

1. **Sessions**: Groups of time that define when we observe and measure price action
2. **Ranges**: Boundaries identified by specific price points (PoC, TO, RPP)
3. **Status Tracking**: A progression system that monitors how price interacts with ranges

## Session Hierarchy

The Lipstick system uses five categories of sessions, each serving a specific purpose:

### Session Types (by significance)

1. **Yearly Sessions** (absolute highest significance - full year timeframe)
   - Provide the longest possible timeframe context
   - One per calendar year
   - Track indefinitely until resolved

2. **Monthly Sessions** (highest significance - longest monthly timeframe)
   - Provide the longest monthly timeframe context
   - Track indefinitely until resolved
   - Most significant monthly levels

3. **Weekly Sessions** (high significance - multi-day timeframe)
   - Provide multi-day context and higher timeframe structure
   - Track indefinitely until resolved
   - Highly significant levels

4. **Major Sessions** (significant - single to multi-day timeframe)
   - Used for trade setups and building narrative
   - 5 sessions per trading day (Asia, London, NY AM, NY PM, Afternoon)
   - Track indefinitely until resolved

5. **Minor Sessions** (execution timeframe - intraday)
   - Used for trade execution and confluence
   - 16 sessions per trading day (90-minute segments)
   - Track for 24 hours after True Open, then expire

## How the System Works

The Lipstick methodology operates on a **break and return model**:

1. A range is established at a specific time (True Open)
2. We watch for price to break either boundary (PoC or RPP)
3. After a break, we look for a return to the True Open
4. A complete cycle (break → return → break → return) creates a "resolved" session
5. These resolutions drive the market's "Order of Operations" (narrative theory)

## The Echo Chamber

A critical component of the Lipstick system is correlative analysis between ES (S&P 500 futures) and NQ (Nasdaq futures). By tracking the same sessions across both instruments simultaneously, we identify divergences that create high-probability opportunities as the instruments eventually realign.

**Core Principle**: The market has a desire to synchronize all assets—this is the secret to why markets move.
