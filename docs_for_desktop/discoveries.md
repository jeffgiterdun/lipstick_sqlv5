## Patterns Being Tracked

### Echo Chamber Divergence Thresholds
- **<60 min:** Normal sync, low significance
- **60-360 min (1-6h):** Medium divergence
- **>360 min (>6h):** Large divergence, significant
- **>1440 min (>1 day):** Extreme divergence, very strong signal

### Session Hierarchy Importance
- Yearly > Monthly > Weekly > Major > Minor
- Higher timeframes drive lower timeframe behavior
- Resolutions cascade down the hierarchy

### Swing Classification Significance
- **Class 1-2:** Noise, minor structure
- **Class 3:** Structural - key support/resistance
- **Class 4:** Major structural shift
- **Class 5-6:** Extreme events - rare, multi-day impact
